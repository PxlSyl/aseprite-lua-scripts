# aseprite-lua-scripts

As pixel artists, we need some good lua scripts to save us a huge amount of time!

My own lua scripts I can't find online

For now :

- zoom-effect :

Works better with small canvas.

A zoom-in zoom-out tool for your sprites. Simple to use, multidirectional (right, left, bottom, top, top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left)
Just enter the zoom percentage you want, the number of frames, the direction and if you want a zoom-in or a zoom-out effect. 

You can also set a rotation effect while zooming, with the direction (left or right) and the angle for rotation you want to apply.

The script will handle all of this!

I may improve this to add more options...

Note: One another trick for this script is if you're working with a full image and want a zoom-out effect, first apply a zoom-in effect, then  select all the new frames and click on the built-in option from Aseprite "Reverse frames" in "Frame" menu.
